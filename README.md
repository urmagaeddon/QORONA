🦠 Qorona — AI-Powered COVID-19 Tracking & Prevention Platform
Qorona is a smart, AI-enhanced web platform designed to help the citizens of Qatar manage, predict, and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Built during the height of the pandemic, Qorona combines artificial intelligence, real-time data, drone logistics, and smart user interfaces to deliver a comprehensive pandemic management tool.

🏆 Originally built for a competition. Still being refined with future implementations in mind.

🌍 Project Mission
Our mission is to provide a safe, reliable, and intelligent solution to combat COVID-19 in Qatar by:

Predicting population densities using neural networks

Diagnosing symptoms through an AI-powered questionnaire

Reducing hospital traffic through drone-delivered test kits

Empowering users with smart QR code status tracking

Providing real-time area risk maps to the public

📦 Core Features
1. 🔐 Secure Login System
Login via Qatar ID (QID)

Two-factor authentication via phone number

Passwords protected under strong security policies

2. ❓ COVID-19 Risk Questionnaire (AI-Assisted)
Asks health, location, and contact-related questions

Uses weighted AI algorithms to estimate infection probability

Users scoring ≥60% risk are prompted to request a PCR test

3. 🧠 Where AI Comes In
Population Density Forecasting: Predicts crowd levels across locations using QR code scan data and neural networks

Dynamic Questionnaire Scoring: Learns from usage to improve infection probability estimates

4. 🗺️ Risk Map & Landmark Control
Real-time map of Qatar with color-coded risk zones

Tracks entries/exits using QR code scanners at landmarks

Helps users make safe decisions about movement

5. 🧬 Smart QR Code Status
Color-coded QR codes represent the user’s health status:

🟢 Healthy

🟡 Suspected

🔴 Positive

⚫ Quarantined

QR codes are used to control access to public locations and to track movement for population analysis.

6. 🏥 Capsule Clinics
Mini medical hubs across Qatar

Store PCR testing machines, first aid kits, and medical drones

7. 🚁 Drone Delivery Service
Contactless delivery of home testing kits

Equipped with nasal swabs, thermometers, urine tubes, and sealed return bags

8. 🧪 Request a Test
One-click request for a COVID-19 test

Free for high-risk or quarantined users

Trigger drone dispatch from the nearest capsule clinic

9. 💉 Get Vaccinated
View nearby vaccination centers

Schedule vaccination appointments from your profile

10. 📞 FAQ & Database Hotline
Built-in FAQ section

Central database & hotline for real-time assistance and updates

📱 Future Enhancements
Mobile app version of Qorona

Customizable user interfaces

Integration for tourists/passport holders

Daily health tips (optional opt-in)

Social connections to track family/friends' health status

Real neural network integration with live government data

Full government + hospital API support for real-time updates

🚧 Current Limitations
Population density stats are currently simulated; real-time updates require governmental cooperation

Drone delivery logistics are conceptual and would require national support for implementation

🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned/Used)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JS (prototype)

AI/ML: Neural Networks for predictions (planned)

Backend: Not finalized, envisioned to use REST APIs with secure databases

Logistics: CAD modeling for clinics, Drone routing algorithms (planned)

Security: QID integration, password hashing, 2FA support (planned)
